The room function(spider letter m, spider number n) contained a sentence
  perhaps (m's 3 piece == 'a') so
  	perhaps (n's 2 piece == 3) so
  		n's 2 piece became 1.
  	or maybe (1) so
  		n's 3 piece became 2.
  	or
  		n's 4 piece became 3.
  	Alice was unsure which.
    Alice found "first if".
  or maybe (n's 2 piece >= 4) so
    Alice found function(m,n).
  or maybe (m's 1 piece < 'v') so
    Alice found "third if".
  Alice was unsure which.

array1 had 10 number.
array2 had 5 letter.
Alice found function(array2, array1).
